This folder contains a file that defines a class Ball.<br>
This file must be included in <code>index.html </code> in order to use it in our sketch<br>
<code> sketch.js </code> includes a call to the constructor in the line <code> b= new Ball()</code>. <br>
This makes an object of the Ball class. <br>
Now, the Ball class contains the definition for <code> update() </code> and <code> display() </code>. <br> Any object of this class can be drawn using these functions. this kind of modularity makes it easy to handle multiple objects.
Hint: An array of objects can be updated independently
